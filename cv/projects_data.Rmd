**Wind Analysis Of Northern Yucatan Coast for Kiteboarding (Dec 2018)**

Spark SQL project written in a Jupyter notebook. It uses a very innovative method to convert an irregular time series into an equally spaced time series for easy computation of time intervals. It covers 10 years of data. It has been tested on an AWS EMR cluster with HDFS and on the Databricks environment.
