**Principal Software Engineer, Cadence (Sept 2015 – Current)**

**PCIe Protocol Model:** Highly customizable PCIe protocol model for simulation. Core code written in C/C++. Code base has a lot of legacy from many years.

  * Architected and developed new features related to PCIe Gen4, Gen5 and CCIX protocols.
  * Tracked, debugged and fixed several customer issues using the JIRA system.
  * Trained junior engineers and conducted code reviews as needed.
  * Developed a Code Analytics engine that identifies hotspots of the code based on the number of edits. Written in Python and R.
  * Working on a test generation engine using Machine Learning with TensorFlow.

**Component Design Engineer, Intel Corporation (Nov 2005 – Sept 2015)**

**Irondale/Oakridge/Vistaridge:** Logic analyzer on a chip for QPI protocol (Cache coherency). Owned the interface of the QPI BFM written in C++ (SystemC) with the simulation environment in Verilog and System Verilog.

  * Coded a pre-silicon test environment in a mixture of C/C++, System Verilog and Perl scripts.
  * Developed a library of base classes which were the foundation for a random test environment.
  * Coded wrappers to interface C++ code to a digital logic simulator.
  * Coded Perl scripts to automate the simulation/checking process.

**PCIe controller for Xeon Processor (Ivytown):** Worked on verification of the PCIe root complex integrated in the processor.

  * Ported a checker originally written in C++ to OVM, the checker models as a graph the collection of registers for error logging (Advanced Error Reporting registers).
  * Coded packet error injectors to exercise Advanced Error Reporting in PCIe.

**High Speed Serial PHY:** Design Engineer for a PIPE compliant multi-protocol PHY supporting the following: PCIe (Gen 1, 2 and 3), SATA and USB 3.0 & 3.1. The PHY had a 22nm and 14nm versions. 

  * Worked on the Physical Coding Sublayer (PCS) and the Common Lane Block.
  * Implemented new RTL features and performed ECOs. CDC and power analysis.
  * Signed off reports from Physical design (Synthesis, STA, Reliability, etc.).
