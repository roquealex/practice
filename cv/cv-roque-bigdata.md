## Professional Experience

**Principal Software Engineer, Cadence (Sept 2015 – Current)**

PCIe Protocol Model written in C. It targets Linux systems. Code has a lot of legacy from many years and it is around 400,000 lines.

  * Architected and developed many features of the code.
  * Tracked, debugged and fixed several customer issues using the JIRA system.
  * Developed a Code Analytics engine that scrapes the repository (17 years of history) and identifies hotspots of the code based on the number of edits. A decision tree model is built after to extract bad coding practices. Written in Python and R.

**Component Design Engineer, Intel Corporation (Feb 2009 – Sept 2015)**

Worked on design and verification of a PCIe/USB/SATA PHY, a Server Processor and a GPU.



Coded a pre-silicon testing environment in a mixture of C/C++, System Verilog and Perl scripts.

  * Developed a wrapper to interface the C++ code to a digital simulator.
  * Coded a collection of System Verilog base classes which were the foundation of a random test environment.
  * Coded Perl scripts to automate the simulation/checking process.
  
## Projects

**Wind Analysis Of Northern Yucatan Coast for Kiteboarding (Dec 2018)**

Spark-SQL project written in a Jupyter notebook. It uses a very innovative method to convert an irregular time series into an equally spaced time series. Covers almost 10 years of data. Can run on Databricks.
