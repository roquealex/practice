**Principal Software Engineer, Cadence (Sept 2015 – Current)**

**PCIe Protocol Model:** Highly customizable PCIe protocol model. Core code written in C. Code base has a lot of legacy from many years.
  * Developed new features related to PCIe Gen4 and Gen5 protocols.
  * Architected and developed the transport layer of CCIX protocol.
  * Created a test suite for the new features using UVM.
  * Coached and led a team of overseas contractors for the creation of a test suite for the new features.
  * Trained junior engineers and conducted code reviews as needed.
Debugged and fixed several customer issues using the JIRA system.

**Component Design Engineer, Intel Corporation, Hard IP Group (Oct 2012 – Sept 2015)**

**High Speed Serial PHY:** Worked as a design engineer for a multiprotocol PHY supporting the following: PCIe (gen 1, 2 and 3), SATA, USB 3.0 & 3.1 and MIPI; communication with controller uses PIPE interface. The PHY had a 22nm and 14nm versions. 
  * Worked on the Physical Coding Sublayer (PCS) and the Common Lane Block.
  * Defined the power intent of the blocks using UPF files.
  * Implemented and Documented new RTL features.
  * Implemented several ECOs. Piloted Conformal ECO tool to automate the ECO process. The effort was successful in ECOs not requiring UPF changes.
  * Clock Domain Crossing analysis and Power Intent analysis.
  * Signed off reports from Physical design (Synthesis, STA, Reliability, etc.), Clock Crossing Domain and Power Domain.

**Component Design Engineer, Intel Corporation, Server Development Group (Jul 2010-Feb 2009)**

**Integrated IO PCIe controller for Xeon (Ivytown):** Worked on verification of the PCIe root complex integrated in the processor, especially on RAS and Advanced Error Reporting features. This includes error injection, reporting, handling and contention.
Ported a checker originally written in C++ to OVM, the checker models as a graph the collection of registers for error logging (Advanced Error Reporting registers).
Coded packet error injectors to exercise Advanced Error Reporting in PCIe.
Coded infrastructure to simulate memory bit errors by randomly flipping bits when reading or writing the array protected by ECC.

**Xeon Phi:** Wrote test plans and developed verification collateral in for different DFX features: TAP (JTAG), Probe Mode (CPU debug), Traffic Recorder and Hardware Breakpoint Controllers.

**Verification Engineer, Intel Mexico GDC (Nov 2005 – Feb 2009)**

**Irondale/Oakridge/Vistaridge:** Logic analyzer functionality for QPI protocol implemented on a single integrated circuit. Owned the interface of the QPI BFM written in C++ (SystemC) with the simulation environment in Verilog and System Verilog.
  * Coded a pre-silicon test environment in a mixture of C/C++, System Verilog and Perl scripts.
  * Developed a library of base classes which were the foundation for a random test environment.
  * Coded wrappers to interface C++ code to a digital logic simulator.
  * Coded Perl scripts to automate the simulation/checking process.
